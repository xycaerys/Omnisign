# OmniSign

Real-time bidirectional sign language interpreter. Converts hand gestures to natural language and renders natural language as 3D avatar sign sequences.

---

## What it does

**Sign → Text** — Captures hand landmarks via webcam, classifies gestures into word tokens, and reconstructs grammatically coherent sentences using an NLP pipeline.

**Text → Sign** — Parses natural language input, extracts intent tokens, and drives a rigged 3D humanoid avatar through a bone-level animation sequence.

## Setup

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
uvicorn main:app --reload
# → http://localhost:8000
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:3000
```

### Environment

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com
```

---

## API

### `POST /sign-to-text`

```json
// Request
{ "words": ["HELP", "DOCTOR", "PAIN"] }

// Response
{ "sentence": "Please help me. I need a doctor. I am in pain." }
```

### `POST /text-to-sign`

```json
// Request
{ "text": "I need water" }

// Response
{ "tokens": ["WATER"] }
```

---

## Animation Format

Each sign token maps to an animation file composed of bone keyframes:

```json
{
  "bone": "right_hand",
  "rotation": [x, y, z],
  "time": 0.1
}
```

Keyframes are applied as `mixamorig` bone transformations via Three.js at runtime.

---

## Deployment Notes

- **Render (backend):** Free tier has a cold start delay of 30–50 seconds after inactivity.
- **Vercel (frontend):** Set framework to Next.js. Place all static assets including `avatar.glb` inside `/public`.

---

## Roadmap

- Sentence-level sign generation
- Facial expression and non-manual marker support
- ISL and multi-language expansion
- Mobile deployment
- Real-time voice output
